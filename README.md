google-buffer-analysis
======================

this program is to analysis the google buffer.there you can see which url you visit most and your username,even your password.and other sensentive information and so on


this is still some problems:
1、encoded
2、linux is not supported
3、some error has no return
4、the rules are very simple
5、don't do with the cookies file

all must be improved.and if I have spare time,I will do it,if you have the interests ,you are welcomed to download the code and improve it more perfect.
